"""Starting and stopping the children Zimi shells out to.

Zimi runs three long-lived subprocesses — warc2zim's sidecar, the zimit
container, yt-dlp — and every one of them is a process TREE, not a process. The
sidecar starts Chrome, which starts a renderer per tab, a GPU process and a
zygote. Terminating the one PID Python holds leaves the rest running, adopted
by init.

That would be untidy and little else, except that none of it was being reaped
either. Both streaming runners collected the child only on the happy path, so
every cancel, timeout, or exception out of the progress sink — which is the
cancellation checkpoint and therefore RAISES by design — skipped both the kill
and the reap. On Eric's NAS, where the container runs without an init process
and PID 1 is `python3 -m zimi serve` (which reaps nothing), that left 20
zombies in 21 hours: 12 chrome-headless, 7 python3, 1 wget.

The zombies were the symptom worth noticing, not the cost. A zombie is a few
bytes and a PID slot. What preceded each one is a browser that should have
stopped and did not, still reading from a saturated disk, for a capture whose
result had already been thrown away.

So: start every child in a group of its own, and stop the group. Two functions,
used by both runners, so there is one answer to "how does a child die here".
