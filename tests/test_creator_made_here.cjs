// Made Here has to actually arrive.
//
// Eric, 2026-09-13, on the NAS: "Why does this never load?? 😭 drop the made
// here section entirely?" It never loaded, and nothing about the server was
// wrong — the endpoint answers in 41ms and the provenance it needs was already
// cached on disk. The pane erased its own answer.
//
// _creatorHtml() builds the pane as a STRING and, part way through building it,
// calls _creatorLoadInventory(). When the inventory is already in hand that
// used to fill the slot synchronously — writing into the DOM the pane is about
// to replace — and then the string being built, which still contains the
// "Loading…" placeholder, was assigned over the top. Nothing filled it again.
//
// The cruel part is that it happens precisely when the answer is ALREADY here,
// so the faster the server, the more reliably it hangs. Chasing it through the
// server was chasing the one part that was working.
//
// Run: node tests/test_creator_made_here.cjs   (exit 0 = pass)
