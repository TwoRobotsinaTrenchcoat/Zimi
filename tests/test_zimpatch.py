"""A capture's ZIM carries what only the capture could know.

The alive and zimit engines hand a WARC to warc2zim, which writes the ZIM and
accepts nine flags. Everything Zimi learned while capturing — which entries are
pages, what URL each came from, what the live page looked like — was dropped at
that door, and the damage was not confined to the capture: one two-page site put
eight hundred asset URLs into the library's shared vocabulary.

So the file is rewritten once at creation. These tests hold the two rules that
make that safe: only standard fields used as the spec intends plus ``X-``
metadata, and nothing else moves.
